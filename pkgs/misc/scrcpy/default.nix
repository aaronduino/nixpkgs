  # postPatch:
  #   screen.c: When run without a hardware accelerator, this allows the command to continue working rather than failing unexpectedly.
  #   This can happen when running on non-NixOS because then scrcpy seems to have a hard time using the host OpenGL-supporting hardware.
  #   It would be better to fix the OpenGL problem, but that seems much more intrusive.
